# DeFi Journal 📖

This repository is my personal journal while exploring **Decentralized Finance (DeFi)**.  

## Things I'm tracking
- 🏦 Lending & borrowing platforms  
- 💸 Stablecoins and their use cases  
- 🌐 Decentralized exchanges (DEXs)  
- 📈 Yield farming & staking experiments  

## Why I'm doing this
I want to keep my learning public, stay consistent, and share notes about the exciting world of DeFi.
